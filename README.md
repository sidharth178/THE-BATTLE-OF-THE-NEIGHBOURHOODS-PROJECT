### Problem Statement

Due to its central geographic location and generally welcoming climate, Dubai is known for its international atmosphere. It is home to close to 2.5 Million expatriateswho make up 90% of the total population and it hosts close to 15 Million visitors per year. My proposal, then, is an analysis of the neighborhoods in Dubai for the consideration of opening a new Mexican restaurant. The objective is to have a location that is within one of the more reasonable rent zones, but also within a close enough range (5km) to a ‘high’ rent zone. The assumption that proximity to high rent neighborhoods would result in takeout opportunities or provide residents an option to travel to our restaurant.

### Elements to consider:

1. Average rents by neighborhood
2. Ratio of Hotels to Restaurants
3. Proximity to ‘high rent’ neighborhoods

### Data Overview

The data that we will use for this analysis is a combination of a CSV file that has been prepared for the purposes of the analysis from multiple sources (Dubai_neighborhoods.csv) and the location/venue information in foursquare.

DIFC would be the best choice considering all the factors: medium rental index, relative high volume of things to do for tourists and locals, it is a business center, it is close in proximity to other high rent neighborhoods, and the ratio of hotels to restaurants is not too high. Other neighborhoods that were considered were Barsha Heights and the Dubai Marina. Although Barsha Heights seems preferable given the low ratio of hotel venues to restaurants, it is not a particularly well know neighborhood and people would likely not travel there specifically to eat. It is also only close to one of the ‘high rent’ neighborhoods. Finally, Dubai Marina was not a preference as it is already saturated with restaurants.
