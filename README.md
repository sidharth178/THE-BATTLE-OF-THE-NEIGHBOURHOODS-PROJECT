* **Description:** This Wikipedia page contain all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. We will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the Toronto dataset.
2. ***Geographical Location data using Geocoder Package***
* **Data Source:** https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data
